## Question No. 1
> Write a Java program that uses two predefined integers. The program should then calculate and print their sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.
- Hint: Use Java's basic mathematical symbols (+, -, *, /, %) for each required calculation.

## Question No. 2
> Create a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else statements.
- Hint: Use relational operators (> , < , ==) to compare the number with zero.

## Question No. 3
> Write a program that uses a switch statement to print the day of the week based on a number (1-7).
- Hint: Use case statements for numbers 1 through 7 with appropriate day names.

## Question No. 4
> Create a while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.
- Hint: Initialize a counter variable, set condition for counter <= 10, and increment the counter.

## Question No. 5
> Write a for loop that calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 50.
- Hint: Use modulus operator (%) to check if a number is even.

## Question No. 6
> Create a do-while loop that asks for user input until they enter a positive number.
- Hint: Use Scanner for input and condition to check if number > 0.

## Question No. 7
> Write a program that uses nested if-else statements to find the largest of three numbers.
- Hint: Compare each number with the other two using logical operators.

## Question No. 8
> Create a program that uses a for loop to print the multiplication table of a given number.
- Hint: Loop from 1 to 10 and multiply each iteration by the given number.

## Question No. 9
> Write a program that uses a while loop to reverse a given number (e.g., 123 becomes 321).
- Hint: Use modulus and division operations to extract and reverse digits.

## Question No. 10
> Create a program that uses a switch statement to perform basic calculator operations (+, -, *, /) on two numbers based on user choice.
- Hint: Use char variable for operator choice and cases for each operation.
