# Question No. 1
> Write a Java program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else statements.
- Hint: Use relational operators (>, <, ==) to compare the number with zero.

# Question No. 2
> Create a program that uses a switch statement to print the day of the week based on a number input (1-7).
- Hint: Use case statements for numbers 1 through 7 with appropriate day names.

# Question No. 3
> Write a program that uses a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
- Hint: Initialize a counter variable, set condition for counter <= 10, and increment the counter.

# Question No. 4
> Create a for loop that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.
- Hint: Use a counter variable and accumulate the sum in each iteration.

# Question No. 5
> Write a program that uses a do-while loop to ask for user input until they enter a number greater than 100.
- Hint: Use Scanner for input and condition to check if number > 100.

# Question No. 6
> Create a program that uses nested if-else statements to find the largest of three numbers.
- Hint: Compare each number with the other two using logical operators.

# Question No. 7
> Write a program that uses an if-else-if ladder to assign grades based on marks (A: 90+, B: 80-89, C: 70-79, D: 60-69, F: below 60).
- Hint: Check conditions in descending order of marks.

# Question No. 8
> Create a program that uses a for loop to print the multiplication table of a given number.
- Hint: Loop from 1 to 10 and multiply each iteration by the given number.

# Question No. 9
> Write a program that uses a while loop to check if a given number (e.g., 30) is even or odd.
- Hint: Use modulus operator (%) to check divisibility by 2 and print "Even" or "Odd".

# Question No. 10
> Create a program that uses a switch statement to perform basic calculator operations (+, -, *, /) on two numbers.
- Hint: Use char variable for operator choice and cases for each operation.
