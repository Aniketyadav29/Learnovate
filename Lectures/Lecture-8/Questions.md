# Question No. 1
> Given an array `int[] arr = {3, 7, 2, 9, 4}`, sort the array in descending order and print it.

# Question No. 2
> Given `int[] arr = {4, 2, 7, 4, 9, 4}`, find the first and last index of the number 4.

# Question No. 3
> Given `int[] arr = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}`, count and print how many times each number occurs.

# Question No. 4
> Given `int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}`, reverse the array in-place.

# Question No. 5
> Write a method that returns `true` if an array is sorted in ascending order, otherwise `false`.

# Question No. 6
> Given `int[] arr = {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}`, copy only the even numbers into a new array and print it.

# Question No. 7
> Write a program to find the second largest number in an array like `int[] arr = {10, 20, 4, 45, 99}`.

# Question No. 8
> Given `int[] arr = {1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1}`, print all duplicate elements only once.

# Question No. 9
> Merge two sorted arrays:  
> `int[] a = {1, 3, 5}` and `int[] b = {2, 4, 6}`  
> into a single sorted array.

# Question No. 10
> Implement your own version of binary search to find a number in a sorted array.
