# Question No. 1
> Write a Java program that uses two predefined integers. The program should then calculate and print their sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.
- Hint : Use Java's basic mathematical symbols (+, -, *, /, %) for each required calculation.


# Question No. 2
> Write a Java program that checks if a person is eligible for a special discount based on a predefined age. The eligibility criteria are: the person must be either younger than 12 or older than 65. The program should print true if they are eligible and false otherwise.
- Hint : Compare the age against the two required limits and use a logical operator to see if either condition is true.


# Question No. 3
> You are tracking product inventory, which starts at 500 units. First, a new shipment doubles the stock. Then, you sell 150 units. Use the compound assignment operators (*=, -=) to update the stock value and print the final count.
- Hint : Use shorthand operators to modify the stock variable's value based on its current value.


# Question No. 4
> Write a program to show the difference between pre-increment and post-increment.

- Initialize an integer a to 10.

- Use the pre-increment operator (++a) and print the result.

- Initialize another integer b to 10.

- Use the post-increment operator (b++) and print the result.

> On a new line, print the final value of b to show how its value changed after the operation.
- Hint : Observe how the timing of the value update differs depending on where the ++ is placed.


# Question No. 5
> A student "passes with distinction" if they score 80 or more and their attendance is 90% or higher. Write a program with predefined values for marks and attendance. The program must use the logical AND (&&) and relational (>=) operators to determine the result and print a boolean value (true or false).
- Hint: Combine two separate comparison checks into a single condition using a logical AND.
