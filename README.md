## 🚀 About JAVA & DSA  

### **JAVA**  
Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** widely used for **software development, Android apps, and backend systems**.  
It is known for:  
- Platform independence (**Write Once, Run Anywhere**)  
- Strong **OOPs concepts** (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)  
- Rich **standard libraries**

### **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)**  
DSA is the **core of programming**. It teaches us how to **store, organize, and process data efficiently**.  

Key Topics:  
- **Arrays & Strings**  
- **Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues**  
- **Trees & Graphs**  
- **Searching & Sorting**  
- **Dynamic Programming**

## 📂 Repository Structure  

Each lecture have its **own folder** 

### Example:  
- [Lecture-1](./Lecture-1/)  
- [Lecture-2](./Lecture-2/)  
- [Lecture-3](./Lecture-3/)  

*(More folders will be added as sessions continue 🚀)*  

---

## 🏆 How to Use This Repo?  

1. **Pick a lecture folder** (e.g., `Lecture-1`).  
2. Open `questions` and try to solve problems **on your own first**.  
3. Once done (or if stuck), check the solution inside `solutions`.  
4. Practice regularly to **strengthen problem-solving skills**.  

> 🚫 Don’t directly copy solutions. Treat them as **learning references**, not shortcuts.
