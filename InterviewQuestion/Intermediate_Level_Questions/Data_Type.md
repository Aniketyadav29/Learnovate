## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Level

### Data Storage & Formats
26. **In what format is Integer data stored in memory unit?**  
    **A:** base-2 format

27. **In what format is real number data stored in memory unit?**  
    **A:** IEEE format

28. **In what format is character data stored in memory unit?**  
    **A:** UTF-16 format or UTF-32 format

29. **Does Java follow ASCII or UNICODE? Why?**  
    **A:** UNICODE. Because UNICODE would be having binary representations for all the symbols of all the languages which are currently used across the globe

30. **Why did UNICODE come into existence?**  
    **A:** Because ASCII does not have binary representation for all the symbols of all the languages which are currently used across the globe

31. **What is UTF?**  
    **A:** UTF stands for Universal Translational Format

32. **What is UTF-8? When is it used normally?**  
    **A:** UTF-8 is used whenever binary representations for only English and its associated symbols are required in the project

33. **What is UTF-16? When is it used normally?**  
    **A:** UTF-16 is used whenever the binary representations for all the symbols of all the languages which are currently used across the world are required in the project

34. **What is UTF-32? When is it used normally?**  
    **A:** UTF-32 is used whenever along with current languages symbols, even ancient languages symbols' binary representations are required in the project

35. **How many bit format is ASCII exactly?**  
    **A:** 7 bit format

36. **Why is ASCII format forcefully stored as 8-bit format?**  
    **A:** Because minimum memory that can be allocated is 1 Byte i.e. 8 bits

### Type Conversion & Operations
37. **How can you convert double data type to float data type in Java?**  
    **A:** i) By explicit typecasting: `float a = (float) 24.17;`  
    ii) By adding suffix 'f': `float a = 24.17f;`

38. **What is meant by rounding towards zero in integer division?**  
    **A:** Truncation, i.e. fractional portion is truncated and only the integer portion is retained

39. **What is meant by truncation?**  
    **A:** Truncation is the process of eliminating the fractional part and retaining only the integer portion. It is also called as rounding towards zero

40. **What is the difference between the prefix and postfix forms of the ++ operator?**  
    **A:** Pre increment: increment first and then assign, post increment: first assign and then increment

41. **Can a double value be cast to a byte?**  
    **A:** Yes

42. **Express double a = 123.45 in scientific notation?**  
    **A:** double a = 1.2345E+2

43. **What is the difference between declaring a variable and defining a variable?**  
    **A:** `int a;` // declaring, `int a=100;` // defining
