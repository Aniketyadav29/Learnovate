## Beginner-Friendly Questions üî∞

### Q1: Should a main() method be compulsorily declared in all java programs?
**A:** Yes. The main() method is the standard entry point for any standalone Java application. It's the method the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for to begin executing your program.

### Q2: What is the return type of the main() method?
**A:** So that the main method becomes accessible to the JVM even without object creation. The JVM can invoke it directly without needing to create an instance of the class that contains it.

### Q3: Why is the main() method declared static?
**A:**  So that the main method becomes accessible to the JVM even without object creation. The JVM can invoke it directly without needing to create an instance of the class that contains it.

### Q4:What is the argument of main() method?
**A:**String args[] which is a variable sized array (dynamic array) that is used to collect command line arguments when the program is executed.

### Q5:Does the order of public and static declaration matter in main() method?
**A:** No. The order of the modifiers public and static is interchangeable. Both public static void main(String[] args) and static public void main(String[] args) are valid.


### Q6:  What is meant by orientation?
> Orientation refers to Perspective (or) Point of view (or) the way we look at things. In programming, it often relates to different approaches like object-oriented programming.

---

### Q7: Why should we enclose main() method within a class?
>An error message would be displayed as "Main method not found error" because the JVM, which is external to your class, would not have access to the main() method.
---

### Q8:What happens if we do not declare main() as public?
> n error message would be displayed as "Main method not found error" because the JVM, which is external to your class, would not have access to the main() method.

---

### Q9:  What happens if we do not declare main() as static?
>An error message would be displayed as "Main method is not static error" because the JVM would be unable to call the method without an object instance.

### Q10: Which command in java is used to invoke the java compiler?
> javac command is used to invoke the Java compiler. For example, javac MyProgram.java compiles the source file into a .class file.



## Intermediate-Level Questions üßë‚Äçüíª

Q1: How does Java's two-step execution model achieve both portability and security?
It achieves both through the use of bytecode:

Portability: The compiler produces universal bytecode that can run on any device with a compatible JVM.

Security: The Bytecode Verifier analyzes bytecode to ensure it doesn't perform illegal operations before execution.

Q2: Explain the difference between a StackOverflowError and an OutOfMemoryError.
StackOverflowError: Occurs in Stack Memory when recursive method calls fill up the stack.

OutOfMemoryError: Occurs in Heap Memory when there's no space left for new objects.

Q3: Why are Strings immutable in Java? Discuss one benefit.
String objects are immutable meaning their value cannot be changed after creation. A key benefit is security - it prevents malicious code from changing String values after they've been checked for security.

Q4: What is garbage collection and why is it necessary in Java?
Garbage Collection is the process by which the JVM automatically reclaims memory occupied by unused objects. It's necessary because it frees developers from manual memory management and prevents memory leaks.

Q5: Explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding.
Method Overloading: Same method name, different parameters within the same class (compile-time polymorphism).

Method Overriding: Same method signature in subclass as parent class (runtime polymorphism).

Q6: What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?
Abstract Class: Can have both abstract and concrete methods; single inheritance; represents "is-a" relationship.

Interface: Traditionally only abstract methods (Java 8+ allows defaults); multiple implementation; represents "can-do" relationship.

Q7: What is the purpose of the static keyword?
The static keyword means a variable or method belongs to the class itself, not to any specific instance. There is only one copy of a static variable shared among all objects.

Q8: Can a Java application have multiple classes with a main method?
Yes. When running the program, you specify which class's main method to execute. The JVM will only invoke the main method of the class named in the command.

Q9: What are the valid signatures for the main method?
The only signature recognized by JVM is: public static void main(String[] args)
Variants like static public void main(String[] args) are technically valid but less conventional.

Q10: How can you pass command-line arguments containing spaces?
Enclose them in quotation marks. Example: java MyProgram "argument with spaces" anotherArgument



## Expert-Level Questions üöÄ

Q1: Beyond String[], could the main method accept a different parameter type?
Technically yes, you can overload main with different signatures, but only the standard public static void main(String[] args) is recognized by JVM as the entry point.

Q2: What is the module system's impact on the main method (Java 9+)?
The main method itself hasn't changed, but you can now define a main class directly in module-info.java using the uses directive, allowing simpler execution commands.

Q3: Discuss the security implications of command-line arguments.
Command-line arguments are insecure for sensitive data as they're visible in process listings and shell history. Use environment variables or secure credential stores instead.

Q4: How can you handle complex command-line arguments?
For complex applications, use dedicated parsing libraries like Apache Commons CLI, picocli, or jcommander that handle parsing, validation, and help generation.

Q5: Explain the class loading process for the class containing the main method.
The class is loaded by the JVM's Application Classloader from the classpath. It undergoes bytecode verification before the JVM looks for the main method to begin execution.

Q6: What happens during JVM initialization before main() is called?
Before main() executes, the JVM:

Loads the specified class and its dependencies

Verifies bytecode for security

Allocates initial memory structures

Initializes static variables of the main class

Q7: Can the main method be declared final?
Yes, adding final to the main method doesn't affect its executability. The JVM only cares about the signature: public static void main(String[])

Q8: What is the effect of declaring the main class as final?
If the class containing main is declared final, it cannot be subclassed, but this doesn't affect the execution of the main method itself.

Q9: How does Java handle cultural localization in main method arguments?
Command-line arguments are received as raw strings. Any encoding or localization concerns must be handled explicitly by the application code.

Q10: What are the performance implications of large command-line arguments?
Very large arguments may cause performance issues as they're stored in memory and processed by the JVM. For extremely large inputs, consider using file-based input instead.
