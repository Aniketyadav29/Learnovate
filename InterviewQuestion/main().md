## Beginner-Friendly Questions 🔰

### Q1: Should a main() method be compulsorily declared in all java programs?
**A:** Yes. The main() method is the standard entry point for any standalone Java application. It's the method the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for to begin executing your program.

### Q2: What is the return type of the main() method?
**A:** So that the main method becomes accessible to the JVM even without object creation. The JVM can invoke it directly without needing to create an instance of the class that contains it.

### Q3: Why is the main() method declared static?
**A:**  So that the main method becomes accessible to the JVM even without object creation. The JVM can invoke it directly without needing to create an instance of the class that contains it.

### Q4:What is the argument of main() method?
**A:**String args[] which is a variable sized array (dynamic array) that is used to collect command line arguments when the program is executed.

### Q5:Does the order of public and static declaration matter in main() method?
**A:** No. The order of the modifiers public and static is interchangeable. Both public static void main(String[] args) and static public void main(String[] args) are valid.
