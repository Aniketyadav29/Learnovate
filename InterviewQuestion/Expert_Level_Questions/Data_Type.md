# Java Data Types Interview Questions - Categorized by Difficulty

## ðŸŽ¯ Expert Level

### Advanced Concepts
55. **Why does Java provide primitive data types in spite of the fact that it makes it only 99% OOP?**  
    **A:** Because creation of variables using primitive data types is faster than creating an object using wrapper classes

56. **Why does Java provide four data types to manage Integer type data?**  
    **A:** Because in real world integer data exists in varying magnitudes

57. **Why does Java provide two data types to manage real number type data?**  
    **A:** For less precision and higher precision i.e. double type provides more accuracy than float type

58. **How do we make a project coded in Java a pure OOP project?**  
    **A:** Using wrapper classes

59. **What is the role of wrapper classes in Java?**  
    **A:** Using wrapper classes, creation of primitive variables can be avoided and hence a pure object oriented project can be developed

60. **What happens if a larger magnitude data is assigned to a value of a data type which cannot handle it?**  
    **A:** Overflow or loss of precision occurs

61. **Should type casting be performed explicitly?**  
    **A:** Depends upon whether implicit or explicit typecasting is performed

62. **Does type casting reduce the precision of the data?**  
    **A:** Depends upon whether implicit or explicit typecasting is performed. Implicit typecasting does not reduce precision whereas explicit typecasting reduces precision

63. **Should numeric promotion be performed explicitly?**  
    **A:** No. Numeric promotion also known as implicit casting or java automatic conversions where conversion of a smaller numeric type to a larger numeric type takes place

64. **Does numeric promotion reduce the precision of the data?**  
    **A:** No

65. **What is numeric promotion?**  
    **A:** When data of a smaller magnitude is placed within a memory location of a larger magnitude, it is called as numeric promotion. Implicit typecasting is also called as numeric promotion

66. **Give the implicit upcasting chart or numeric promotion chart?**  
    **A:** (Refer to Java documentation: byte â†’ short â†’ int â†’ long â†’ float â†’ double)

67. **Which Java operator is right to left associative?**  
    **A:** Assignment operator (=)
