# Question No. 1
Integer Sum Challenge
> Problem: Write a Java method sumPrimes(int n) that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all prime numbers up to n. You must use primitive data types (int and boolean) for all calculations and variables.

Hint: Think about how you would use a boolean array (`boolean[]`) to keep track of prime numbers using an algorithm like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

# Question No. 2
String Manipulation with char
> Problem: Create a Java program that accepts a string as input and counts the frequency of each character. The output should display each unique character and its count.

Constraint: You are only allowed to use a primitive type (`char`) to represent the individual characters, and a non-primitive type like an array (`int[]`) to store the counts. Do not use any Map or other collection classes.

# Question No. 3
 Object-based Array Sorting
> Problem: Design a Person class with String name and int age fields. Create an array of Person objects. Implement a simple sorting algorithm (like bubble sort or selection sort) to sort this array based on the age of each person.

Focus: This problem requires you to manage an array of non-primitive objects. Your sorting logic must swap the entire Person objects (references), not just their individual fields.
# Question No. 4
Memory-Efficient String Check
> Problem: Write a Java method containsDuplicate(String[] words) that checks if a given array of strings contains any duplicate words.

Constraint: You cannot use any Set or Map data structures. You must use a nested loop approach.
