## Primitive Datatype

### Question No.1
>Temperature Conversion -
Write a Java method `convertCelsiusToFahrenheit(float celsius)` that takes a temperature in Celsius as a **primitive `float`** and returns the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit. The formula is $F = (C * 9/5) + 32$.
### Question No.2

>Simple Calculation - 
Create a method `calculateTotalCost(int price, int quantity)` that accepts a product's price and quantity as **primitive `int`s**. The method should return the total cost. This problem tests basic arithmetic with primitive types.

### Question No.3

>Boolean Logic -
Write a method `isEligibleToVote(int age)` that takes an age as an **`int`** and returns a **`boolean`** value. It should return `true` if the age is 18 or greater, and `false` otherwise.

## Non-Primitive Data Types

### Question No.4 
> Array Sum -
Given a pre-defined **integer array** `int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}`, write a method `sumArray(int[] arr)` that calculates and returns the sum of all elements in the array. This problem focuses on iterating through a **non-primitive array**.

### Question No.5

> String Length -
Write a method `getStringLength(String text)` that takes a **`String`** and returns its length as an **`int`**. This problem highlights the use of a simple method (`.length()`) on a non-primitive type.
